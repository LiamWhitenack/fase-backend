# GOAL

I would like to incorporate a bunch of this into my current courses, here is a description of the end-of-year projects

## Machine Learning II

The semester project will require students to apply a machine learning technique covered
during the semester to discover knowledge in a real-world dataset. Project examples
include but no limited to classification of IoT / CPS data (smart city, smart home, smart
industry), e.g., city traffic data, crime data, etc., clustering of stock market data, pattern
mining applied to social network data. Students will be required to submit a project
proposal to the instructor before carrying out the execution of the project. Projects
should generally follow the steps of the knowledge discovery process and should give
details on the cleaning, integration, selection, transformation, and mining of the data.
This will include selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the
knowledge discovery problem at hand. Projects should also report on the evaluation of
the approach and use visualization to present the discovered patterns. Students are
encouraged to use available machine learning tools covered in class such as Python and
R.

## Data Science Statistics

Student Presentation: Students will seek and find an article in the published literature (data science or computer science) that uses some of the statistical concepts we discussed in the course to either test/evaluate an algorithm or estimate some attribute of interest (i.e. proportion of data scientists who are using various computer software tools).  The presentation will highlight the data used, the particular questions/objectives of the study and the statistical tools/concepts used to answer the objectives and any conclusions.  Presentations should include specific references to the results and how they were presented.  Each presentation will be no more than 5 minutes and will follow a standard StudentPrez Template.  The presentation may also contain an original data analysis component, to be determined.
