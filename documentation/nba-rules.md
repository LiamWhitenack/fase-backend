## Max Contract (not actually the max)

The amount of the cap you can receive is dependent on how long you've been in the NBA:

0-6: 25%

10+: 35%

The most that the contract can expand per year is 5%

The maximum number of years is 4


## Supermax

If you've been appointed the honors of all-NBA, DPOY, MVP, or all-NBA the last two seasons, and been on the same team you were with on your rookie contract for 7 years, you're eligible for the supermax:

Player who has played seven or eight seasons with two years left on contract can earn a four-year supermax
Player who has played seven or eight seasons with one year left on contract can earn a five-year supermax
A free agent who has completed eight or nine years in the NBA can sign a five-year supermax

There can only be 3 supermax players on the same team.
